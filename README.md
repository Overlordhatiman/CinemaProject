Ways to Improve
1. Use Fluent API with Entity Framework

    Define your entity configurations using Fluent API for more control and customization.

2. Choose Appropriate Architecture

    Consider using a layered architecture like Clean Architecture or Onion Architecture to promote separation of concerns and maintainability.

3. Implement CQRS Pattern

    Separate your application's concerns into commands and queries for better scalability and maintainability.

4. Separate Models

    Ensure that your domain models are separate from your view models to maintain a clear separation of concerns.

5. Add OAuth for Authentication

    Implement OAuth authentication to secure your application and allow users to sign in using third-party providers like Google or Facebook.

6. Optimize CSS Performance

    Minimize CSS files, reduce HTTP requests, and utilize CSS pre-processors like SASS or LESS for improved performance.

7. Implement Client-side Validation

    Use JavaScript to perform client-side validation for user input to enhance user experience and reduce server load.

8. Implement Unit Testing

    Write unit tests for your application's components to ensure reliability and facilitate future changes.

9. Enable Logging and Monitoring

    Implement logging and monitoring to track application behavior and identify issues proactively.
